Tim Boyle,QB,TimothyMBoyle,"That also tells me that we are heavily tracking students, in math, and that the sanctity of Algebra I-&gt;Geometry-&gt;Algebra II/Pre-Calc-&gt;Statics/Calc is operating feature of the day"
Tim Boyle,QB,TimothyMBoyle,"There are as few as 8 kids taking the test at Ludlow and as many as 157 at Baldi, but no matter where, all 8th don't take the test. I'd imagine there are multiple factors at play, but K-8 schools with &lt;60 per grade being the mode type of configuration in the city has to up there"
Tim Boyle,QB,TimothyMBoyle,"the difference between Algebra I pass rates and pssa pass rates is very interesting, especially at catchment schools, it is almost triple the pass rate between tests. Carver had 75% pass rate for Keystone but 55% rate for pssa, that seems to not make much sense"

Tim Boyle,QB,TimothyMBoyle,"at the catchment level, 34 schools offered the test so 31% of catchment schools had the option, the pass rate among those schools was 49.3%, they had 17.1% pass for the math pssa in 8th. Only 32% of 8th graders in those schools took the Keystone"
Tim Boyle,QB,TimothyMBoyle,"43 out 119 school with 8th graders offered the test, so 36% of K-8 or middles schools or high schools with middle grades"
Tim Boyle,QB,TimothyMBoyle,"for the last ""normal"" year 1,776/8,754 8th graders in SDP took the test, or 20%. The pass rate of those students was 53%. That compares with an 18.4% pass rate for the math PSSA with 95% 8th graders taking the test"

Tony Jones Jr.,RB,Tjonesonthenba,PUNCH IT IN!!!!
Tony Jones Jr.,RB,Tjonesonthenba,That first 15 minutes was as good as we have been all playoffs. But that was a bad last five minutes. Can’t keep giving up 17 shots on goal in a period. Carolina is way too good offensively for that to be sustainable

Tony Jones Jr.,RB,Tjonesonthenba,The whistles stopped and the Celtics opened it back to 14…looks like the Heat are gonna have to make some shots

Tony Jones Jr.,RB,Tjonesonthenba,They gotta get Herro out of the game….he’s like 20 percent
Tony Jones Jr.,RB,Tjonesonthenba,@MyconMusic You’re right tho he shouldn’t cost too much
Tony Jones Jr.,RB,Tjonesonthenba,@MyconMusic He hasn’t played more than 36 games since 2017…..I just can’t trust it bro

John Kelly,RB,RndmForestRunnr,"2nd amendment? Ok, sure, let people own an 18th century gun if properly trained &amp; licensed. Drawing a line beyond the original context is arbitrary.

Tom Kennedy,WR,tomaskenn,"South Dakota’s Republican Governor Kristi Noem just said this at the NRA convention:

“Now is not the time to quit. Now is the time to double down.""

The GOP is a death cult."
Tom Kennedy,WR,tomaskenn,Has Ron DeSantis said anything since the shooting in Texas? Has he backtracked yet from his lunatic promise of enacting permit-less open carry gun laws in Florida or is he still moving forward with that awful idea?
Tom Kennedy,WR,tomaskenn,"In Texas, it's illegal to own more than six dildos. They regulate sex toys more than guns. What an embarrassment."
Tom Kennedy,WR,tomaskenn,"If you are wondering why Marco Rubio reflexively is against any common sense gun reform it’s because he has taken $3,303,355 in campaign donations from the NRA. He is a pay to play politician and Floridians deserve better.
https://t.co/9cbHJKZibR"
Tom Kennedy,WR,tomaskenn,"Legislatures in 33 states are considering at least 229 bills that seek to politicize, criminalize, or interfere with elections. Democracy is in crisis.

Tom Kennedy,WR,tomaskenn,"42 billionaires worth a combined $275 billion are supporting Ron DeSantis campaign. Is it any surprise that since DeSantis became governor, Florida has given $5.7 billion from our tax dollars in corporate giveaways?
https://t.co/whp5jPv4EZ"
Tom Kennedy,WR,tomaskenn,The Republican solution to gun violence is to ramble incoherently about having “one door” in school. They ran out of all their other idiotic talking points they usually employ to divert attention. Morally and ideologically bankrupt.
Tom Kennedy,WR,tomaskenn,"If you are wondering why Marco Rubio is attacking the NBA because they advocated for ""common-sense gun laws"", it's because he is a pay to play politician who has gotten $3,303,355 in campaign donations from the NRA."
Tom Kennedy,WR,tomaskenn,"Wrote about how Viktor Orbán’s right-wing regime is serving as a model for U.S. conservatives and they don't even bother to hide it, as CPAC in Hungary shows.

Tom Kennedy,WR,tomaskenn,This is what the Republican U.S. Senate candidate in Georgia has to offer as a solution to gun violence. This is disqualifying. https://t.co/T2bw4EEyst
Tom Kennedy,WR,tomaskenn,Florida law enforcement has a dossier on me and a secret list of people they deem “associates” of mine because of political criticism of Ron DeSantis. We had another court hearing to get them to disclose this list.  How many tax dollars will be wasted trying to keep it a secret? https://t.co/iccQiHcykv
Tom Kennedy,WR,tomaskenn,"Here’s some of the money the NRA spent in 2018 to support Ron DeSantis.

Is it a surprise he hasn’t said anything about 19 kids being murdered in the Uvalde school shooting?

Or that he’s not backing down from his lunatic promise to enact permit-less open carry gun laws in FL? https://t.co/tqqbRZkzwQ"
Tom Kennedy,WR,tomaskenn,"Ron DeSantis has at least 42 billionaire donors. Is it any wonder he has given over $5.7 billion in corporate giveaways from our tax dollars whole Florida becomes the most unaffordable state in the country?

Tom Kennedy,WR,tomaskenn,"Parents of children murdered in Texas were so upset police waited almost an hour to go inside the school while the shooter was inside, they considered going in themselves.

“Let’s just rush in because the cops aren’t doing anything they are supposed to.”
https://t.co/MeQlnsSlic"
Tom Kennedy,WR,tomaskenn,Republicans have become so unhinged and nonsensical that their new talking point to address school shootings in this country is to talk about having only “one door” for the whole school. Just goofy and idiotic stuff from a party that has nothing to offer to the public.
Tom Kennedy,WR,tomaskenn,"The NRA spent $1.8 million in 2018 to elect Ron DeSantis and Rick Scott.

Marco Rubio has received $3,305,355 in campaign donations from the NRA.

These pay for play politicians will always do whatever the NRA wants them to do."
Tom Kennedy,WR,tomaskenn,"Rick Scott invoked the fifth amendment 75 times when being deposed after committing the largest case of Medicare fraud in U.S. history and was fined $1.7 billion for it. Now he has proposed a plan to dismantle Social Security and Medicare.
https://t.co/7eFiIQFU3Q"
Tom Kennedy,WR,tomaskenn,Pretty wild to learn that police got into a firefight with the shooter right outside the school and they still allowed him to get inside and murder all those kids. Demolishes the already demolished myth of a “good guy with a gun” solution to gun violence.
Tom Kennedy,WR,tomaskenn,"The newly appointed Secretary of State by Ron DeSantis, who was photographed on a boat with a QAnon flag, won’t admit that Trump lost the 2020 election. This is the unhinged conspiracy theorist that DeSantis appointed to oversee elections in Florida.

https://t.co/29cdx84ZMj"
Tom Kennedy,WR,tomaskenn,Has Ron DeSantis said anything about the shooting in Texas that left 19 children death? Any condolences at least? We need the press to ask him if he is backing down from his lunatic promise of enacting open carry gun laws in Florida.
Tom Kennedy,WR,tomaskenn,"At least 42 billionaires and members of billionaire families worth a combined $275 billion are supporting Ron DeSantis' campaign. Is it any wonder that DeSantis has given over $5.7 billion in corporate giveaways? He is a pay for play politician.
https://t.co/goanfQgHBD"
Tom Kennedy,WR,tomaskenn,"Marjorie Stoneman Douglas survivor Cameron Kasky asked Marco Rubio if he would stop taking money from the NRA. 

Watch what a sniveling coward Rubio is when trying not to give a straight answer. 

Pay for play Rubio has taken over $3,303,355 in campaign donations from the NRA. https://t.co/6jl8EteYHl"
Tom Kennedy,WR,tomaskenn,What does Randy Fine do after 19 children are murdered by senseless gun violence? He threatens the president of the U.S. because he wants more guns out there. This is the same guy who threatened to cut funding for the special olympics because he wasn’t invited to a fundraiser. https://t.co/xsJh6xnx6L
Tom Kennedy,WR,tomaskenn,"Marco Rubio has received $3,303,355 in campaign donations from the NRA and Ron DeSantis wants to enact open carry gun laws in Florida. Both of these corrupt, pay for play politicians dare to later call themselves “pro-life.” They are hypocrites."

Tyler Lockett,WR,TDLockett12,And each law can be challenged once while the same people are in office. And once we get new people in office new laws can be given that would require the country to vote again.
Tyler Lockett,WR,TDLockett12,I feel like anytime the people in power want to create new laws. The entire country should be able to vote on it. Not just the people in power. The same way people get voted in should be the same way every law gets passed.

Tyler Lockett,WR,TDLockett12,Are there any consequences for people who make these laws and refuse to do anything to change them? It just seems like the people who create these laws and regulations do so without having to face any type of consequences. Just a thought

Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"The 2022 NBA Finals start on Thursday and we've got you covered on @celticsblog! Everything you could want is here, as I went deep to preview Celtics-Warriors:

-The History
-The Guards
-The Forwards
-The Centers
-The Reserves
-The Coaches
-The Prediction

https://t.co/XRAKzKPJCw"
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,I would ask why you care so much. But I guess you've had nothing else to care about for two weeks. https://t.co/nf5VbzqRNU
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"Let me correct this:

Ime Udoka said there is ""no concern"" with Marcus Smart heading into the Finals.

I'm tired y'all. https://t.co/jijGix7sCK"
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"Ime Udoka said Celtics staff members that have been to the NBA Finals have been sharing with the rest of the roster what to expect as far as being in the Finals and coverage.

He also said Al Horford does a good job keeping the team level-headed."
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"Ime Udoka on winning the East: ""We're not hanging a banner here for that. We enjoyed things that night and had fun. But that night, guys were already talking about what's next. This isn't what we came to do. There's still work to be done."""
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"Ime Udoka said Marcus Smart is fine and there is ""no concern"" on his availability heading into the playoffs."
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"Ime Udoka on the Warriors: “The core is the core. What they do well is shoot the ball. But I think teams kind of overdose on that at times. It's a lot of the little things that get them going."""
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"Ime Udoka on Rob Williams: ""Rob's alright. He feels good. We kept his minutes low, and that's beneficial for him. But the days off going forward too."""
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"This is a surprise, from everything I've heard and read. Seemed like he was one of the risers in this class.

But you know what? Good for him! I'm good with guys wanting to stay another year. He has a chance to improve his draft stock even more with a big season in school. https://t.co/hjAq5GmWg1"
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"I'm not sure OG Anunoby is going to find a bigger role on a contender, or a team that's better than Toronto.

So, does that mean he's happy to be the best player on a lesser team?

Whole thing is interesting for both Anunoby and the Raptors. They are really close to being great. https://t.co/lbsxgFnAFM"
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"@sawyer_gibbons The NBA date is almost always 10 days ahead of the draft.

The NCAA makes their own rules, which the NBA has no say in or control over."
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"Today and tomorrow are pretty big days for the 2022 NBA Draft.

NCAA players who want to return to college have until tomorrow, June 1, to decide if they are staying in the 2022 NBA Draft or not. Several have already withdrawn.

The NBA's withdrawal date is not until June 13."
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"Thanks to all who reached out with kind words on my latest articles over on @celticsblog. Or simply to pass along their appreciation in general.

Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,@IAmKelvin201 @celticsblog I think he'll re-emerge in this series. The Warriors don't hunt mismatches like the Heat do.
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"Last week I took a shot at projecting what might happen with the 39 remaining player and team options for @spotrac. Harden, Kyrie, Beal, Dort, they're all in there. A projection for each and what it might mean for the players and teams:

https://t.co/arMIXRpD8N"
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"Yeah and it didn't happen.

We spend way too much time on focusing on real negative stuff.

Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"Boston has made two adjustments against the doubles on Tatum:

-A guy is flashing middle at the top of the key.

-A guy is staying way deep out near halfcourt.

Either way. Tatum has an outlet."

Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,Marcus Smart needs to relax. He's pulling these shots way too quickly.
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,Lowry and Smart both flopped on the same play. LoL.
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"Three fouls on Grant Williams.

That's huge with Rob Williams looking very limited."
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,That's a big pull from Jaylen Brown. No hestitation.
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"Rob is trying so hard, but he just can't move."
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,Short rest for Tatum and Smart. Both are checking back in next whistle.

Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"The Heat are really struggling to score against the Celtics halfcourt defense, as they have all series long.

The problem is that Boston keeps gifting them points off turnovers.

The story of the playoffs for the Celtics. Turn it over, lose. Control the ball, win."
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"Pending these free throws coming from Butler:

8 turnovers for the Celtics
6 steals for Miami
8 points off turnovers for the Heat"
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,I don't know if you can play Jaylen Brown right now.
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"Smart spent that entire possession face-guarding Robinson. Horford had a nice strip, but ball bounced to Miami for a Martin three."
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"That drive by Smart was the first time Boston has attacked Robinson when the Heat weren't in zone.

If he's going to be out there, the Celtics have to go at him."
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,Celtics haven't scored in nearly 5 minutes of game-time.
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"This is a rock fight, except the rocks are just breaking windows and stuff because neither team can hit anything."
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"Grant is acting like an idiot. Didn't like getting bumped into on a screen and then ran directly into the path of the Heat player.

Can't have stuff like that. Just play through it."
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"Yeah, that's inexcusable there. You can't let a guy run in without being touched like that."
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"Bad numbers for the Celtics early:

6 turnovers
8 Heat points off turnovers
5 Miami offensive rebounds

That has to clean up or Boston will be down 2-3."
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"Heat lead 19-17 after one

White - 6 points
Rob - 4 points
Brown - 4 turnovers
Celtics - 41.2% FGs
Celtics - 1-5 threes
Celtics - 6 turnovers

Adebayo - 6 points
Butler - 5 points
Vincent - 4 points
Heat - 37.5% FGs
Heat - 1-7 threes
Heat - 4 turnovers
Heat - 5 offensive rebounds"
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"Four turnovers for Jaylen Brown in the first quarter.

His ballhandling has to be a mental thing right now. This is a mess."
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"Bam back in. Watch for him and Robinson to work the DHO game for Miami.

Dedmon seems to be out of the Heat rotation."
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"Duncan Robinson getting some run. He hit some shots in garbage time in Game 4. Let's see what he has for Game 5.

Look for the Celtics to go right at Robinson on the other end of the floor."
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,@Yruzi1 Because that won't help anything?
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,Tatum is leaving his jumper short again. Have to wonder how much that right shoulder is bothering him.
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"Back-to-back turnovers for Brown. Not great. Made a three after though.

Heat have gone small and quicker."
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,Heat look their best when they get Bam involved and play through him more. The challenge? Bam looks wiped out from all the early action.
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"Another quick, aggressive start for Derrick White.

Once again, Boston is about 100x better when they push the ball and attack before Miami can set the halfcourt defense."
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"Incredible follow by Bam, but the Celtics can't let that happen. Gotta block out. Initial defense has been way too good to allow these second chances."
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,This game is a mess for both teams early. Both offenses are all sorts of out of sync.
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,Two early fouls on Marcus Smart. He's out and Derrick White is in.
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"Jayson Tatum did something to his right shoulder again. Derrick White was up to sub for him, but Tatum waved off the sub and White went back to the bench.

Then Tatum just drove and drew two free throws. He's shaking and flexing his right arm out though."
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,Celtics sticking with that drop coverage against certain Heat PnR ballhandlers.
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"You want it? You need it? You got it!

LET'S FUCKING GO!!! https://t.co/DWdYWUj0o8"

Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"The Miami Heat ended their moment of silence for the victim of the Robb Elementary School shooting with: “The Heat urges you to contact your state senators by calling 202-224-3121 to leave a message demanding their support for common sense gun laws.”

Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"Jayson Tatum said his right shoulder is feeling ""a lot better"" and that it won't keep him from playing."
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,Jayson Tatum said he's thankful and grateful for the recognition of making All-NBA First Team.
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,Ime Udoka said the Robb Elementary School shooting hit home for him as the parent to a son of a similar age as the victims: “Getting those calls is unimaginable to find yourself in that situation as a parent…These things continue to happen and no wakeup call. Nothing changes.”
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,Udoka restated that Rob Williams will be day-to-day for the rest of the playoffs.
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"Ime Udoka said both Marcus Smart and Rob Williams are feeling better and will test things pregame, but both remain questionable."
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"Payton Pritchard: ""We know what we need to do: Take care of the ball and set the tone defensively.""

Pritchard added the Celtics are aware of the need to avoid turnovers given how the first four games of the series have gone."
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,@AdamTaylorNBA I think playing is playing. I don't think holding down his minutes would have an impact on his availability. But that's just a guess on my part.
Keith Smith,FB,KeithSmithNBA,"No shootaround for the Heat this morning. That means no injury updates from them until later today.

Boston is having shootaround. We may get some injury updates shortly, but don't necessarily count on it. Both Marcus Smart and Robert Williams are questionable for Game 5 tonight."

Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,It would be great honor all these Number 10's one day .. https://t.co/kc7lAuiViN
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,@BMop25 Love Junior !!!
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,@coachneighbors He has good instincts.... ha..
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,Making history !!!! https://t.co/m74ZXmshM1
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,DVH said he didn't expect to host a regional.  He cited their RPI and their poor play late in the season.
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,Looks like a good draw for the Hogs.  Love tourney time. https://t.co/aNpZcsJ70s
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,The hopes and dreams for a group of players have never been higher. https://t.co/hXcdF2N82R
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,@dane_womack He took the last five shots.
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,Marcus Smart doing his best to shoot Boston out of the lead.  How many 3's is he going to shoot ??? 10 and counting..
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,"@GottliebShow I didn't think it was possible, but Lowry flops more than Smart."
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,@SlaterMoJoe Block/charge calls have been horrendous...
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,It pays to flop with the officials tonight #Game7
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,"Still a little shocked that the Baseball Hogs fell so dramatically , so fast. I know we will all miss seeing a regional played at Baum-Walker."
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,It's great to see how much these softball Hogs who came to Arkansas from other states enjoyed their time as a Razorback.  All were part of a special time for the program.
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,When they start honoring softball greats...  She will be in the first class.. https://t.co/FWMGdG9mIF
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,@EricPMusselman @coltenwalker3 @AnthonyRuta Look who trained him ...
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,@bjones4672 Ellsworth had the best swing of the day.
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,"A year ago, Arkansas Baseball swept the SEC regular season and Tourney titles and pounded NC. State in game one of the Super Regional at Baum-Walker.Then lost two in a row.I remember how sick I felt that day.  Feeling the same way today. Nothing worse than seeing Texas celebrate."
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,Delce was great again today.  What an addition.  No run support ...
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,The Hogs have had two runners on in 4 innings in this game.
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,Simpson is reminding me of the freshman from Oregon St. who beat the baseball Hogs in the title game.   She has had the Hogs' number all game.
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,Texas has made all the defensive plays today...
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,Gibson's ball was the best hit ball of the game for Arkansas..  A good sign...
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,This is it for Arkansas.  This has been their inning.  The big bats have to deliver.
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,This is starting to look real bad.... A fourth straight hit makes it 3-0 for Texas.
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,Washington two-run double and the Horns lead 2-0 in the 6th ..  and looking for more.
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,Jefferson is a one-woman wrecking crew. Sides will normally make that play.
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,This is old-school college softball.  The only 0-0 game going.
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,"They need that one ""big"" swing ...."
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,@RazorbackSB Smacks ????? ha..
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,Big play by Gammill.. That could have been a disaster.   She showed great poise.  Delce is in the zone..
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,"Offensively, Arkansas is doing what they did yesterday.  Expanding the zone. Simpson has at least 3 strikeouts on balls way out of the strike zone."
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,A little plate discipline and they will get to Simpson.  Not throwing many strikes....
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,"Off the glove, Off the base ... How about over the fence ??????"
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,Money !!! https://t.co/ARRusxuNM6
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,"I've been impressed with Texas the last two days, but Today, I think they will feel the true impact of the Bogle bombers.  Nothing like a Game 7 or a Game 3 .. One game to decide it all."
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,"A one and out, followed by a two and out..  Muss can sell Fayetteville as the fast track to realizing your NBA dream."
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,J-Will makes it official.  Wish him well.  Great legacy.  Back to back Elite Eights. https://t.co/82v2wU6TfE
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,There’s nothing better than celebrating a trip to the World Series on your field in front of the best fans in College softball.A great opportunity for the SEC champs !!!
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,Both Coach Deifel and Danielle Gibson talked about Arkansas' inability to make adjustments as a key to the game.  They jumped all over that inside pitch all game which resulted in lot of long strikes..
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,@McArkbball 3 pm..
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,"Texas wins game two 3-1 . The Texas pitcher with
a gutsy performance.   Arkansas should have a big pitching edge in Game three..."
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,Too many good swings to have just one run.
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,How many foul balls have left the park ???  At least 20..
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,We still haven't seen a home run from the Hogs.  I have to believe one is coming soon.
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,"Delce in for Haff , and she is greeted with an RBI double.  Horns have scored 3 in the third.  3-1 Texas."
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,Back to back homers for Horns.  2-1 Texas ...
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,Texas ties game with a solo home run.  1-1 bottom of the third.
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,"Gammill with an epic at bat... 16 or 17 foul balls.. then she's robbed of a hit on a hot shot up the middle.. 1-0 Arkansas in the third inning,."
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,"Too hot to handle !!! The best hitter in College Softball Danielle Gibson, with an RBI single.  Hot shot off first baseman's glove.
1-0 Hogs.."
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,Over now. Hogs lose 7-5.  Time to get well and get ready for the NCAA tourney.
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,"Hogs aren’t done just yet in Hoover. Brayden Webb with a two out, two run bomb. 7-5 Gators in the 9th inning."
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,Good news on Tygart.  SEC Network says it’s not an arm issue.   They said he just didn’t feel well.
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,"Gators now lead 7-2.  When things aren’t going your way, it seems like every ground ball finds a hole."
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,Love this news !!! https://t.co/KG4ZCCw5QM
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,@PhilElsonPxP Ha.  Enjoy !!!
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,@MzRMoody You guys are living the dream !!!!
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,Kacey Hoffman showed the importance of just making contact when runners are in scoring position.   She hit two harmless ground balls that forced Texas to make plays under pressure.  The result. Two errors and four Arkansas runs.
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,@suggartown @DavidBazzel 6:30 Eastern time
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,Moses Moody with another solid performance tonight.  He played 8 minutes in the first half .  He scored 7 points .
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,"Chenise Delce looked like the SEC pitcher of the year tonight.  A gritty performance.     Hogs win 7-1   .  Delce allowed 6 hits, walked one and struck out six !!!!!!!!!!"
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,Hogs making more history tonight !!  First super regional win and first win over the Texas softball team.  A 7-1 win !!  They will go for the sweep tomorrow at 5:30 pm.
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,"A Texas meltdown.  Wild throw from third baseman allows two runs to score. 7-0.  Hogs are one run away
from run ruling Horns !!!"
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,Malkin with an RBI single.  5-0 in the 6th.  Hogs want more !!!
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,Gammill does it again !!!! Took a pitch low and outside and punched it into right field for an RBI single.  4-0 Hogs !!!!
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,"A throwing error by first baseman results in two more runs.  Hogs are rolling  , now up 3-0.  Starter is out for Horns."
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,Beebe's Hannah Gammill rips one through a hole on the left side .. RBI single makes it 1-0 in the bottom of the 5th. Hogs looking poised to have a big inning.
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,The Hogs get Florida tomorrow.  The Gators got run ruled by the Aggies. 10-0 after 7.   Barring any more delays.  The game will start at 9:30 AM.
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,These early kickoffs aren't ideal for Arkansas in September. https://t.co/NwrkgeSvrv
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,"I heard a stat during one of the rain delays at the SEC Tourney that Arkansas now has the longest active streak of consecutive winning seasons in SEC play. It's only 4 seasons.Among those below 500 this year,  Vandy, Ole Miss, and Miss. St.  All three were ranked to start season."
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,"@skylinenlr Tough year, but they still have enough weapons to do damage in NCAA tourney.. you never know"
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,@TheJayBir My bad.   Ran out of characters
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,@TheJayBir Conference stats.
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,@TheJayBir In the SEC.  No.
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,"The biggest difference between this year's Hog Baseball team and last year's squad is the power numbers. Both teams were built for power. Last year, Hogs were #1 in both Home runs and walks.   This season, 6th in home runs and 4th in walks.  Not bad numbers, but not elite."
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,@r_scott_miller one thing they do have is elite back-end pitching.  Hope in the NCAA is to get to them with the lead.
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,"One common thread in these Bama losses.  The Hogs have helped Bama.  As Bubba Carpenter would say
"" that's not Razorback baseball""."
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,"Hogs lose 4-3.  A couple of defensive lapses and only 5 hits.   With weather forecast, it's hard to say when they will play next."

Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,Holt among 4 inducted to Arkansas Sportscasters and Sports Writers Hall of Fame https://t.co/sZgQJhcCok
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,"Big swing from Lanzilli !!  Two run shot.   4-3 Bama. Lanzilli also saved a run earlier, gunning down a runner at the plate.     Hogs still batting in the bottom of the 6th."
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,"Wasted a great opportunity in the 5th. Two on, no outs.. and Battles , Gregory and Wallace failed to deliver a hit..  Still 4-1  Bama .."
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,Wild throw from Turner trying to pickoff runner from third results in a 4th run scoring...  4-1 Bama going to the bottom of the 4th inning.
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,Big ball from Battles!!!3-1 Bama in the third.
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,"Congrats to the new class of the Arkansas Sportscasters and Sportswriters Hall of Fame.  Left to right,Mike Irwin,Chris Mortenson,Mike Nail and Bob Holt . https://t.co/dBxfsSI9lq"
Stephen Sullivan,TE,sully7777,"What can do wrong seems to go wrong for this Hog Baseball team.  Robert Moore trying to turn two ..Stovall couldn't
handle one-hop throw..  2 runs score.  Bama leads 2-0 in the second."

Seth Williams,WR,newsethwilliams,"I am sorry, I was wrong. A total of 54 Philadelphians were shot and of those 14 have died. Staggering. Let’s pray for those that are grieving and collectively work to reduce GunViolence and all of its underlying causes."
Seth Williams,WR,newsethwilliams,An extremely violent weekend in Philadelphia leaves 40 people shot and of those 14 have died with several still in critical condition.

Seth Williams,WR,newsethwilliams,@DomShow1210 Krasner thinks HE has all the answers &amp; EVERYONE else is wrong. As long as he talks tough against police &amp; lawmakers in Harrisburg he will appease enough lemmings in Philadelphia that they will not hold him accountable for not doing his part in GunViolence prevention&amp;prosecution
Seth Williams,WR,newsethwilliams,@GalenMicheal We had nuclear bomb drills in the ‘70’s. Somehow they were to save us from “nuclear annihilating”.
Seth Williams,WR,newsethwilliams,"@LanceCharen @JoeHoldenCBS3 @CBSPhilly Yes, but almost all of those guns were owned legally at some point in the past. Legislation that requires reporting of lost or stolen guns helps reduce “straw purchases” and those that profit illegally from the sale of firearms to those that can’t possess them legally."
